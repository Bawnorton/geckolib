v4.5.8

- Add support for invisible, partially-invisible, and glowing entities for AutoGlowingGeoLayer
- Add additional checks for invalid buffer states while rendering. This is still a temporary fix util I can rewrite the underlying API in the next breaking version
- Account for translucent rendering when rendering invisible entities in spectator mode
- Make AutoGlowingGeoLayer account for overlay colouring when rendering
