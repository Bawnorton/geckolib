v4.5.3

- Move the lighting setup in GeoItemRenderer to before the buffer VertexConsumer setup so that custom handlers can apply proper context #584
- Move lighting setup in GeoItemRenderer to its own method #setupLightingForGuiRender for easier manipulation
- Remove `final` from GeoModel#handleAnimations in exchange for an APIStatus.Internal annotation to allow for overriding. Users should continue to avoid overriding this unless explicitly necessary
- Remove unused cached animatable instance in renderers after rendering to avoid memory leaks
